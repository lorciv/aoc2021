# Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). I am writing my solutions in Go. I try to keep them as simple as possible.

Below are some comments.

## Day 7

I found Day 7 to be quite straightforward. I model the positions of the crabs as an immutable slice of ints. While populating such slice, I keep track of the min and max values. The target position we're looking for will be in that range.

Once the slice of positions is ready, I compute the cost of every possible target position and find the minimum one. That's the result.

I wrote the `fuel` function as recursive, however I suspect that an iterative version may be more efficient. Also, with the given input, the function can call itself more than 1000 times, which is not so far from the limit of around 8000 that is set by default on my computer. An iterative version would avoid the risk of stack overflow.
